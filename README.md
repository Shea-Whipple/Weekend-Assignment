### Search Query
<br>Notes: Fixed terms searching for partial words i.e foo doesnt return food only "foo" or "Foo" etc
<br>cont--: Only searches in exampledirectory and not ./.git and other files that are for the codespace/git/etc
<br>1. Use the terminal 
<br>2. Run "python script.py" to run the script for searching directories
